        This year marked the beginning of our beautiful journey together.I still remember the first meeting with you during Exploration. When I first saw you, I thought you had some attitude, and I felt like it won’t suit me. I even told myself that I should speak only about work and nothing else. I never imagined anything more than that. In fact, after coming back I even told Vani that my teammate has attitude.

But now today, I can proudly say — I was completely wrong.

You are the best and the most wonderful woman here. I don’t know what good karma I have done to get you as my friend.

The first year was the best part of engineering. According to me, the main characters of my life then were: Rashmi, Shreya, Bhavana, Swati, Raveesh, Pramod, Prajwal, our DTSI teammates and of course Pushpa.

We didn’t travel much, but we enjoyed the classes. We ate a lot of pani puri and spent so much time together. The first birthday was not that special, but I will make sure that your next one will be on another level. We will attend events, wear sarees — the full package of fun.

We also went to Mudagond, we went home, and Exploration was the best part. We enjoyed every small thing — those classes, the quadrangle meetings, arguing with Raveesh, and the silent talkers Pramod and Prajwal made the perfect team.

There was a lot of work, but we never took stress. DTSI was boring because you were missing there. That is when I realised — she is the one who makes me happier.

Lots of love ❤️
