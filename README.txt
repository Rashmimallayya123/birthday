Final Birthday Website (Option C — Pinterest style)
===================================================

Pages:
1) index.html — landing, confetti, play/pause soft piano button
2) year1.html — "Us at 1 year" — two videos + memory note
3) year2.html — "Us at 2 year" — two videos + memory note
4) year3.html — "Us at 3 year" — two videos + memory note
5) info.html — "Information about her" with Pinterest-style photo + text
6) message.html — "Your personal message" video

How to finish:
- Replace music: assets/music/soft-piano.mp3
- Replace videos per page:
  - assets/videos/year1_video1.mp4, year1_video2.mp4
  - assets/videos/year2_video1.mp4, year2_video2.mp4
  - assets/videos/year3_video1.mp4, year3_video2.mp4
  - assets/videos/final_message.mp4
- Replace images (hero.png, info_photo.png, message_poster.png) with your own.
- Open index.html in your browser. Click the "Play music" button (autoplay may be blocked until you click).

No navbar — each page uses "See more →" buttons as requested.
Confetti only on the landing page.
Theme: black + blue + pastel, Pinterest pin borders.
