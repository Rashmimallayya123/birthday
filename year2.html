        This year we had ups and downs but our bond became stronger.The second year started very badly. That separation happened — and it hurt. But after a week everything changed when we shifted to Division D. From there we created so many memories.

Goa trip on your birthday — I still remember I told everyone about it even before reaching. I had planned it earlier. Dandeli trip was also amazing — we enjoyed so much. Even though we had projects, headaches, stress — everything — in the end we stayed strong.

These full 2 years, one thing I truly love is that our friendship never broke or became weak. We always took care of each other. We ate a lot, we watched movies, and life was like a roller coaster — but at the end we were still friends — and we still are.

Lots of love. I still say — you are the best part of the 2nd year also. ❤️
