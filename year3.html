        This year she became the most precious person to me.Now we are already in 3rd year, and yes — the stress is real. But everything happens for a reason, and we must stay strong. I hope better things come our way. Whatever is written in destiny will happen, but we should still give our best efforts.

Edge AI was super challenging. We even came during holidays, we went for movies, and even while doing all that work — we still managed to have fun. Aradhathi ma’am, Eranna, Sai Kiran, you and me, our ML project — everything… we have so many memories.

And I know we will complete everything together.

I hope you have a great birthday this year — and you are still the best chapter of this year too. Lots of love. All the best for the future. I hope I will be part of your future. I pray to God that I always want you by my side. Even your future husband — my jiju — should know that you were my best friend.

And I have one small wish — I want to be your bridesmaid.

Okay bye — lots of love ❤️
